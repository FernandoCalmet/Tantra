# Tantra Devs

[View Docs](https://fernandocalmet.github.io/tantra)

The purpose of this page is to document the content of the Tantra Online video game. Include information on game aspects and also guides for server developers.

If you want to get access to a private repository where developer files are kept and shared, you can do so by acquiring a [commission](https://ko-fi.com/fernandocalmet/commissions) on the administrador [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/fernandocalmet). If you want to maintain your subscription to the repository and the support group in discord, you must collaborate with a monthly coffee for the group administrator.
