# Add Weapons

## Step 1

Open the file `TantraParam.xml` and we locate ourselves in the `Item` sheet.

![TantraParam.xml: Open](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FernandoCalmet/Tantra/master/extras/img/development/items_management/weapon/01.png)

First we must be clear if the weapon will be one-handed or two-handed. Based on this, we can locate ourselves in a position in a row to add a new one.
